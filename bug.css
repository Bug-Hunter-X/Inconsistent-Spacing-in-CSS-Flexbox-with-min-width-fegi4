The following CSS code results in unexpected behavior in some browsers:

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
}

.item {
  background-color: lightblue;
  padding: 10px;
  min-width: 100px;
}
```

This CSS intends to distribute three `.item` elements evenly across the `.container`, but due to the `min-width` property, the spacing might not always be uniform. The total width of the three `item` elements might exceed the container's width, leading to unexpected wrapping or overlapping.

The problem is particularly noticeable when the browser window is resized, as the space between elements changes dynamically and unexpectedly.
