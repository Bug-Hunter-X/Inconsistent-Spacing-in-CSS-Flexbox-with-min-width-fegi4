To address the inconsistent spacing, we can use `flex-shrink` to allow items to shrink if necessary to maintain even spacing. Here's the updated CSS:

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
}

.item {
  background-color: lightblue;
  padding: 10px;
  min-width: 100px;
  flex-shrink: 1; /* Allow items to shrink */
}
```

Adding `flex-shrink: 1;` allows the elements to shrink proportionately to maintain even spacing. This ensures that the layout remains consistent across different screen sizes and avoids unexpected wrapping or overlapping.
